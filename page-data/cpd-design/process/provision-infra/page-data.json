If the state file is lost or corrupted, updates to the infrastructure will have to be done manually. The Ansible tasks have been built in a way that the Terraform state file is always persisted into the vault, even if the apply or destroy process has failed.\n\nThere are 3 main steps:\n\n#### Terraform init\nThis step initializes the Terraform provider (ibm) with the correct version.

The plan step checks **what** will be changed. If infrastructure components are destroyed and the `--confirm-destroy` parameter has not be specified for the deployer, the process is aborted.\n\n#### Terraform apply or Terraform destroy\nThis is the execution of the plan and will provision new infrastructure (apply) or destroy everything (destroy).\n\nWhile the Terraform apply or destroy process is running, a `.tfstate` file is updated on disk.
